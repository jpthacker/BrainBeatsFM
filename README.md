BrainbeatsFM is a project I worked on as part of the training for my level 4 Software Developer Apprenticeship with Makers. 

The aim was to make an app whereby users could share and recommend music in genre-defined 'rooms'. Click the image above to see the app in action!

After the project was completed, I branched off the main repo and looked to improve the use of TypeScript throughout the codebase as a way of shoring up my knowledge.
