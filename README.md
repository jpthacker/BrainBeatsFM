## Project Pitch

### Music app (Sound-Drop) with the possibility of integrating Ai.

- Rooms that have different genres of ai-generated music.
- Users can enter into each room and listen to different genres of music.
- Users can possibly generate songs from within the app.

## Project Setup ToDo

- ~~Discuss how we will work in a team~~
- ~~Rules; Boundaries; Sprint times, schedules etc~~
- ~~Repo & File Structure (api / frontend)~~
- ~~Trello board setup~~
- ~~Dedicate time to re-visiting Acebook/React/anything that wasn’t clear in the previous project~~

- Diagrams/Figma

- Technologies that we will be using.

  - What will they require?
  - Resources on the technologies we will be using (Tailwind CSS, Music API, AI, Next.js, TypeScript)

- Requirements for the app

  - Accounts/Tokens?

- Mood Board (Figma)
  - Websites that look good.
  - Inspiration.

## MVP

Account Set Up

- So the user can sign up/in and have a profile that other users can see, e.g. in rooms etc.
- Their profile will allow them to vote on tracks within the rooms.
- Landing page that sends the user to a sign-up/in page.
  Sign-up page
- So that the user can sign-up
- Username, Picture, email and password.
  Sign-in page
- So that the user can sign-in
- Email and Password
  Log-out
- So the user can log-out.

NON-MVP FEATURES

- Over a set period of time, the most played tracks will be able put into a top tracks playlist.
- User can add tracks using AI.
- Users can favourite rooms.
- Comments in rooms.
- Look at users profile
  - Shows their liked songs.
  - Shows their name and picture.
  - Shows their favourite genres. (Possibly done on sign-up)
- Order the rooms in the feed depending on user preferences.
- Feed/Master room page.
- This is so the user can see all the rooms, and therefore, choose the genre of music they want to listen to.
  Room pages.
- Each room shows the list of tracks.
- Can change the order of the tracks by voting.
- Track that is at the top of the queue will play.

## Tech Stack

- React
- MERN
- Next.js

## And that's f\*\*king teamwork!!!

- Morning stand-up - 10:00 - 10:15
- Dinner/Lunch - 12:30 - 14:00
- Retro (sprints last 2 days) - 16:30 - 17:00
- Meetings whenever necessary
